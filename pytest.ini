markers =
    unit: Fast tests with isolated components and mocks where appropriate
    integration: Real components interacting (e.g., real filesystem, config) but not full desktop
    acceptance: Full-system tests requiring live MCP server, VS Code windows, and LLMs
    e2e: End-to-end behavior across agents
    slow: May take significant time
    mcp: Tests that require MCP tooling
    vision: Tests that require vision model
